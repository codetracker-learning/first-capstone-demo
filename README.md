# Presentation Instructions

Each presentation should take approximately 3-5 minutes and cover the following material:

1. Goals (30 seconds)
  * Pull these from your elevator summary, user stories and/or README
2. Demo (2 minutes)
  * You don't have to demonstrate all of the functionality, just the high points.
  * In particular, demonstrating the ability to sign in/sign up is a poor use of time unless there is something special about you sign in/up process.
3. Lessons Learned (1 minute)
  * This can be cathartic!
4. Question and Answer time (up to 3 minutes)
  * There will be questions, I promise.  Ask for questions and then pause while people gather their thoughts.

## Important points to remember:
- Use a tool to assist preparing your presentation (Google Docs has slides). This should take you no more than 10 minutes to complete.
- Speak loudly and clearly, and face your audience.
- Be positive and use positive words. DO NOT emphasize broken parts of the program. If you notice a bug while you're presenting, just gloss past it. This is an important skill to learn for giving product demos.
- DO NOT insult your own work. People tend to take a person's self-evaluation at face value and you'll simply be setting people up to think your work is sub-par.
- Avoid referencing other student's presentations in a "well, they covered everything I had to say on my lessons learned". Your presentation should stand alone.
- Your presentation and application should be complete the evening before presentations. You are expected to have your laptop closed and your attention on the presenter during the presentations.
